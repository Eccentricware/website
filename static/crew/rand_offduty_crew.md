They say a Rand a day keeps the crew slots away. In this case it’s literally true. No inherent worth in the card aside from some marginal voyage work on an early roster should one somehow be lacking any DIP. If a prisoner event should come up again she could get a shuttle seat but don’t hold your breath. Her common skill set combined with a few dull traits and zero collections means she’ll probably be replaced by even the most sub-par begolds. Freeze or airlock then forget.
