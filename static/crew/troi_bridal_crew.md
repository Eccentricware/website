Duty. A Big Book writer's life is filled with solemn duty. I have rated crew into obscurity. I have negotiated articles between outrageous proficiencies. I have represented the Timelines Community in first contact with twenty-seven million different cards, but none of this compares to my solemn duty today...of writing this note.

Anytime someone brings up the elusive MED/CMD pairing the first person to come to mind is Reverend Phlox. The stalwart of the genre has now been dethroned as the number one in the pair however it’s a tight race. Deanna by the numbers is every bit Phlox’s counterpart with them sitting side by side in the rankings. By virtue of MED/CMD still being one of the rarer skill sets in the game this gives her value enough to take without the comparisons. 

As a bonus Deanna also grabs a small hit in the Gauntlet on occasion and with Troi’s healthy event count she’s no doubt going to see work throughout the years. Now, I know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed crew. But have you lot considered what you are doing to me?
