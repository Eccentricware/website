There’s a very good phrase that BigMcLargeHuge makes often is “Big Bases, Empty Calories” which is a very apt statement to how large scores can often be deceptive.

What we see with Raffi is two very sizable 1k bases before boosts and another recent addition to the CMD base heavy lifters, but sadly she skipped voyage day. Her slight proficiencies net her a sub-200 voyage rank which isn’t entirely useless but as the plethora of CMD/SEC crew expand the ever nebulous roster she will fall quickly into disuse. Her saving grace is a few useful traits and the potential for a main cast variant in the future on a faction event, but that is very slight use for a card when picking out the citing priorities. I do love that uniform though...
