🐳 🐋 We've reached the point where ranking actual whales in a semi-serious fashion is a thing. George & Gracie's surface level ranks are usable for a beginner's roster and their assorted traits might pop for (more) events in the future, but G&G come up short where the tentpoles of rare crew value are concerned.

Although their nonhuman hidden trait qualifies them for Sunday cadet work, there are superior DIP/SEC options out there including a handful of female aliens who can handle double duty for both days of weekend cadet missions. Without collections or significant arena/gauntlet ability, enjoy this April 1st offering in the spirit in which it's given. 🐋 🐳
