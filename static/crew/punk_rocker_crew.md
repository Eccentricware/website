Punk Rocker? The mad lads done did it, they added into the game a Trek character with less than a minute of screen time and (technically) no actual lines!
"JUST WHERE IS OUR FUTURE, THE THINGS WE'VE DONE AND SAID! LET'S JUST PUSH THE BUTTON, WE'D BE BETTER OFF DEAD!" 
Oooooooh, and so friendly, too. First the bad news: Rocker will not qualify for any Cadet Challenge missions. And helping you crit Cadets is the make-or-break consideration for Uncommon crew.
"I HATE YOU! AND I BERATE YOU!"
Now the good news: Rocker is rocking the #3 SEC score among green crew, so he can help with several Episode mission nodes. He also sports a decent Traits list, including Musician (I guess "boom box" counts as an instrument for STT purposes?)
"I ESCHEW YOU! AND I SAY 'SCREW YOU'! AND I HOPE YOU'RE BLUE TOO."
Charming to the last. Enjoy your nerve-pinch nap, Punk.
